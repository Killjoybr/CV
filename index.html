        <p>I'm a computer engineering student at CEUB, currently on 4th semester, and I love studying anything related to culture and technology. Firstly I wasn't thinking about programming but gladly I had a 
            friend, wich already graduated and is my role model, that was always telling me that the sooner I started, the sooner I would have good results and develop important skills</p>
